            <h3>How to Buy Used Parts (Ebay and Market Place)</h3>
            <div class="help-text">
                <p>Buying used parts on eBay or Facebook Marketplace starts with finding listings that include clear photos, detailed descriptions, and a seller with good reviews or a solid profile history. Before committing, do thorough research on each individual part to understand its typical performance, reliability, and common issues. Ensure the parts work well together by verifying compatibility, power requirements, and platform support. Look up benchmarks and real-world performance tests so you know what to expect and aren't disappointed after purchasing. Always message the seller to ask specific questions about condition, usage history, and whether the item has been tested and works properly. Finally, compare prices, negotiate respectfully when appropriate, and test the part as soon as you receive or pick it up.</p>

            <h3>Negociation Guide</h3>
            <div class="help-text">
                <p>The best way to haggle on Facebook Marketplace starts with finding a listing that has been up for a while, since sellers are often more flexible the longer an item sits unsold. Before messaging, research the item's normal price so you know what a fair offer looks like and can justify it if needed. When you first reach out, be polite and friendly, and ask a simple question about availability or condition before making a low offer. Make your offer reasonable but slightly below what you're willing to pay, and explain it briefly by mentioning market prices, condition, or cash pickup. Stay calm and respectful during counteroffers, and be willing to walk away if the price doesn't make sense. Once you agree on a price, confirm the details clearly, choose a safe meeting place, and bring exact cash to keep the transaction smooth.</p>

            <h3>What to Avoid Buying Used</h3>
            <div class="help-text">
                <p>When buying used items, there are certain parts beginners should generally avoid because they carry higher risk or shorter lifespans. This list is meant for people who are still learning how to buy used parts and may not yet know how to properly test or verify them. Storage drives, especially hard drives and heavily used SSDs, can fail without warning and often aren't worth the small savings. Power supplies should usually be avoided since internal wear isn't visible and a bad PSU can damage other components. As you gain more experience, you'll learn ways to protect yourself when buying these parts, such as bringing a power supply tester and checking the normal power outputs for a specific PSU. Finally, avoid listings with vague descriptions, no testing proof, or sellers who refuse to answer questions, as these are common red flags.</p>

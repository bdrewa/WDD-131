    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This website showcases my custom PC builds and serves as a comprehensive resource for PC building enthusiasts. The site displays detailed specifications, component lists, and photos of multiple builds at different price points. It also provides educational content on how to build a PC and how to find the best deals on components.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The intended audience is PC gamers, hardware enthusiasts, and first-time builders aged 16-35 who want to see real-world build examples, learn how to assemble a PC, and discover money-saving shopping strategies. These users are typically tech-savvy, interested in gaming or content creation, and looking to build their own system rather than buying pre-built computers.</p>

        <p>
          This website will use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic content focused on comparing PC builds. JavaScript will manage the PC comparison feature, including checkboxes for each build and on-screen 
          prompts that guide users to select exactly two builds for side-by-side comparison. It will also handle hover interactions for each build, displaying notifications indicating whether a system is classified as a gaming PC or a workstation. Additionally, JavaScript will 
          toggle detailed component views and respond to user events such as button clicks and form inputs.
